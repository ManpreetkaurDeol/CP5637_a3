<h1>Congratulations</h1>
<p>
When you first learn that you are pregnant, get in touch with a midwife or doctor as soon as possible so that you can start your antenatal (pregnancy) care. This will also help to make sure you receive maternity healthcare that takes into account all your health needs and preferences.

Antenatal care is the care you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy. 
</p><p>
You will be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, or sometimes with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth.It is best to see them as early as possible. If you have special health needs, your midwife, doctor or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they will all see you during your pregnancy. Let your doctor or midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour.</p>
