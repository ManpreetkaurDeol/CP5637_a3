<h3>Baby(0-4months)</h3>
<p> <li>At birth: babies can not support their head unaided. They close their hands involuntarily in the grasp reflex and startle at sudden loud noises.</li>
<li>At four weeks: babies can focus on a face and might respond to a bell in some way (startling, crying, going quiet). They can follow an object moved in an arc about 15 cm above their faces until it is straight ahead.</li>
<li>At six weeks: babies might start to smile at familiar faces. They start to coo.</li>
<li>At 12 weeks: babies can lie on their tummies with their heads held up looking around. They can also wave a rattle, and they start to play with their own fingers and toes.
Although boys usually weigh more than girls and are slightly longer, there is no right size for a newborn. If your baby is active and feeding well, there is no need to worry if they don't fit neatly into the weight-length chart you see on the baby health centre wall.</li>

<h3>Baby(4-8Months)</h3>
<p>
<li>At4 month age Your baby will enjoy making new and different sounds.
Babies enjoy making new and different sounds, and by six months they will also make repetitive noises. There are many ways to help their development, through playing, reading, music and more.</li>
<li>By five months babies can lift and hold objects, but are unable to let go of them. They will often put things in their mouth to explore the taste and texture.At around six months babies learn to pass things from hand to hand. Find toys that they can pick up and move around, as that will help them improve their co-ordination. Singing with your baby is ideal stimulation because it involves language and music. Music without words can be good for young minds at this time too.</li>
Your baby is learning to become more mobile. Some babies learn to crawl backwards before they crawl forwards. Some learn to walk without ever crawling. Others are bottom shufflers. As soon as your baby can crawl, fit safety gates to stop them climbing and falling down stairs. Do not allow your baby to use a baby walker. They are dangerous and can cause serious accidents.
