<h3>DietDuringPregnancy</h3>
<p>
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time, but especially vital if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Healthy eating keeps you feeling good and gives your baby the essential nutrients they need in utero. 
Overall, aim for a balanced diet, with an appropriate blend of all the five food groups:
<li>vegetables and legumes</li>
<li>breads and cereals</li>
<li>milk, yoghurt and cheese</li>
<li>meat, poultry, fish and alternatives</li>
<li>fruit.</li></p>
<p>
Foods containing protein help the baby grow. Meat, fish, chicken, eggs, milk, cheeses, nuts, beans and peas are all good sources of protein. Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of water every day  water contains fluoride, which helps your growing baby's teeth develop strong enamel. You will probably find that you are more hungry than usual, but you donot need to eat for two,even if you are expecting twins or triplets. 
</p> 
<p>If you get hungry between meals, donot eat snacks that are high in fat and/or sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, crisps or chocolate. Instead, choose from the following nutritious snacks:
<li>sandwiches or pitta bread filled with grated cheese, grilled chicken, mashed tuna, salmon or sardines and salad</li>
<li>salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber</li>
<li>low-fat yoghurt or fromage frais</li>
<li>hummus with bread or vegetable sticks</li>
<li>ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes</li>
<li>vegetable and bean soups</li>
<li>unsweetened breakfast cereals, or porridge, with milk</li>
<li>milky drinks or unsweetened fruit juices</li>
<li>fresh fruit</li>
<li>baked beans on toast or a baked potato.</li> </p>
