<h3>Trimester1</h3>
<p>
Conception usually takes place about two weeks after your last period, around the time that you ovulate (release an egg). In the first four weeks of pregnancy you probably won't notice any symptoms. The first thing most women notice is that their period doesn't arrive. Find out about the signs and symptoms of pregnancy.

By the time you are eight weeks pregnant, you will probably have missed your second period. However, some women experience a little bleeding during the early weeks of pregnancy. Always mention any bleeding in pregnancy to your midwife or doctor, particularly if it continues and you get stomach pain.

Your womb has grown to the size of a lemon by the time you are around seven or eight weeks pregnant. You're probably feeling tired. Your breasts might feel sore and enlarged, and you are probably needing to pass urine more often than usual.

Some pregnant women start to feel sick or tired, or have other minor physical problems for a few weeks around this time. Most women stop having morning sickness and start to feel better by the time they are around 14 weeks pregnant.

<h3>Trimester2</h3>
<p>
You may get indigestion or heartburn, and it might be hard to eat large meals as your baby grows and takes up some of the space where your stomach normally is. You may also find you are quite often getting tired.
You may have some swelling of your face, hands or feet. This might be caused by water retention, which is normal (try resting and lifting up your swollen feet to ease it). Be sure to mention any swelling to your midwife or doctor so that they can take your blood pressure and rule out a condition called pre-eclampsia, which can cause swelling.
It is now recommended that all pregnant women receive a pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination during their third trimester (ideally at 28 weeks). A combination of antibodies being passed through the mother’s bloodstream and the reduced risk of the mother contracting the disease makes this an ideal time to administer the vaccine. Most states now offer the pertussis vaccination for free. Speak to your doctor or antenatal care provider to schedule an appointment.

<h3>Trimester3</h3>
<p>When you are around 37 weeks pregnant, if it’s your first pregnancy you may feel more comfortable as your baby moves down ready to be born, although you will probably feel increased pressure in your lower abdomen. If it’s not your first pregnancy, the baby may not move down until labour.

Most women will go into labour between 38 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor should give you information about your options if you go beyond 41 weeks pregnant.

Call your hospital or midwife at any time if you have any worries about your baby or about labour and birth.</p>
